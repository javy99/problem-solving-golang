## üìö Overview

Welcome to my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by solving the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode150) problems using **Golang**. This repository contains my solutions, organized by topic, to help reinforce my understanding and prepare for coding interviews.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Topic-wise Breakdown

### 1. Arrays & Hashing
- Fundamentals of storage and access.
- Must-have for any coding interview.

### 2. Two Pointers
- Techniques for traversing arrays and strings efficiently.

### 3. Sliding Window
- Optimized solutions for subarray and substring problems.

### 4. Stack
- Essential for parsing expressions and backtracking problems.

### 5. Binary Search
- Divide-and-conquer approach for sorted data structures.

### 6. Linked List
- Classic data structure with unique pointer manipulation challenges.

### 7. Trees
- Core topic involving recursion and hierarchical data.

### 8. Tries
- Specialized tree for prefix-based problems.

### 9. Heap / Priority Queue
- Useful for problems requiring dynamic ordering.

### 10. Backtracking
- Recursive approach for exploring all possibilities.

### 11. Graphs
- Covers DFS, BFS, and shortest path algorithms.

### 12. Advanced Graphs
- Includes Dijkstra's, Union-Find, and Topological Sort.

### 13. Greedy
- Builds solutions piece by piece with the best immediate choice.

### 14. 1D Dynamic Programming
- Solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

### 15. 2D Dynamic Programming
- Extends DP to two-dimensional data structures.

### 16. Bit Manipulation
- Efficient techniques for handling binary representations.

## üìå Contributing Rules & Branch Naming Convention

To keep this repository clean, consistent, and collaboration-ready, we follow a few naming and commit conventions.

---

### ‚úÖ Branch Naming Convention

Create branches using the format below:

`<topic>/<problem-name>`

**Example:**
`arrays_and_hashing/two-sum`

---

### ‚úÖ Pull Request Naming Convention

Pull request titles must follow the format below:

`[<Topic>][<Problem Name>] - <What you did>`

**Example:**
`[Arrays & Hashing][Two Sum] - Implement solution using hashmap`
